## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

To layout the page, I used only HTML and pure CSS, without any additional frameworks. While I could have utilized Flexbox or Grid Layout, as well as other frameworks, I chose to do everything manually, adjusting margins and paddings meticulously to align it with the final image.

This helped me enhance my understanding of webpage layout design.


### Continued development

Throughout this project, I discovered that my biggest weakness lay in responsive design. When i was attempting to create the mobile version, I struggled to make it fit reasonably. I still lack proficiency in handling queries, but I plan to continue improving in this area.

### Useful resources

-(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/488830/ol-with-numbers-another-color) - This helped me to learn about the ::marker pseudo-element, and be able to change the color of number in the ordered list.
